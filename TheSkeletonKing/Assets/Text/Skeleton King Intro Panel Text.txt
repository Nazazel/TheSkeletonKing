Back in the mists of time when the world was young ruled a powerful Skeleton King who had gold that would make even the poorest man live like a god. 
He promised riches beyond reason to those brave warriors who could make it out of his deadly mazes unscathed. 

Three brave knights took up the Skeleton King’s challenge and with great precision, made it through the set of mazes to meet the king. 

The king congratulated the three men on accomplishing such a feat. As he shook their hands, the king took out a sharp blade and fatally stabbed all three knights. The Skeleton King laughed as the men laid dying. He revealed the shocking truth as all three took their last breath...there was never any gold.

The knights return as three souls, seeking vengeance on the tyrant Skeleton King who reaped them of their lives. You, the player, will help the souls navigate through the mazes again, avoiding dangerous traps once more to find and defeat the king.
